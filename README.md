This repository contains a chess player classification model created by Benjamín Varela and Eduardo Álvarez, undergraduate students in Data Science at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, for the Data Mining course (IIC2433). The original idea was to analyze a player's chess playing data, to recommend the world champion who has a most similar playing style, so you can learn from him.

It started as a simple final project, but then it became something more personal.
